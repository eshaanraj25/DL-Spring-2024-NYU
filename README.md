# DL-Spring-2024-NYU

This repository contains the code for our Deep Learning project, which was part of the coursework at NYU. In this project, we worked on developing a modified Residual Network (ResNet) architecture to achieve the highest possible test accuracy on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset.

## Introduction

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known benchmark for evaluating image classification models, consisting of 60,000 32x32 pixel images distributed across 10 different classes. ResNet, a deep residual network architecture, has been widely successful in tackling image classification tasks due to its ability to effectively leverage skip connections, which improve gradient flow and enable the training of deeper models.

In this project, our goal was to achieve high test accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a modified ResNet architecture, while keeping the total number of model parameters below 5 million. To this end, we explored various architectural choices, optimizers, data augmentation techniques, and regularization methods to optimize the performance of our model.

Through our extensive experimentation and iterative refinement, we were able to develop a modified ResNet architecture that achieved a test accuracy of 93.55%. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and the power of the ResNet architecture in image classification tasks, even with the constraint on the model size.

The details of our approach, including the specific modifications made to the ResNet architecture, the hyperparameter tuning process, and the analysis of the results, are provided in the comprehensive Project Report.
